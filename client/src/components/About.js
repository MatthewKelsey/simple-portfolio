                  As a Software Engineer I bring a
                  unique perspective to building top-notch web applications
                  using JavaScript, React, and a bunch of other fancy tech
                  tools. With years of experience working in education, I have
                  developed strong communication skills, which allows me to work
                  effectively with clients and team members to ensure that
                  projects are delivered to the highest standard.

                  My experience in React, MongoDB, Mongoose, PostgreSQL,
                  Sequelize, Express.js, and Node, along with my passion for
                  learning, has allowed me to take on new technical challenges
                  and find creative solutions to complex problems.
